# File System Directory Structure Design

## Overview
The file system for the game console OS supports a hierarchical directory structure to manage game assets (e.g., save files, textures). It allows directories and files to be organized efficiently for quick access during gameplay.

## Structure
- **Root**: `/` (main directory)
- **Subdirectories**: `/saves`, `/assets`, `/configs`
- **Files**: Save files (e.g., `/saves/game1/save.dat`), textures (e.g., `/assets/texture1.png`)

## Theme Connection
The structure prioritizes fast access to game save files and assets, critical for seamless gameplay.
