Instructions

Assignees: Each member is responsible for updating their task's status in the corresponding GitHub Issue (e.g., adding comments like "PCB design completed, testing in progress").
Commits: Reference the GitHub Issue number in commit messages (e.g., git commit -m "Implemented PCB design #1").
Weekly Reviews: Simulate weekly meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and new issues. Document outcomes in GitHub Issues or Progress-Report.md.
Traceability: Ensure all changes to code or documentation are linked to a specific task via GitHub Issues for full traceability.

Notes

If a task encounters issues (e.g., scheduler latency), create a new GitHub Issue to track the problem and its resolution.
Update this document if task assignments change, and commit with a reference to the relevant Issue (e.g., #13 for task reassignment).
