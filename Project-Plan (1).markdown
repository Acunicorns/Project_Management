# Game Console OS Simulation Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project simulates a game console operating system optimized for low-latency process management, efficient memory allocation, concurrent handling of game inputs, and a file system for game assets. The system will be developed in Python, using GitHub for version control and task management.

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- **1. Process Management**
  - 1.1 Design Process Control Block (PCB) for game processes
  - 1.2 Implement process creation, switching, and termination
  - 1.3 Implement a Round Robin scheduler with low-latency for game tasks
- **2. Memory Management**
  - 2.1 Implement paging for game asset memory allocation
  - 2.2 Simulate address translation using page tables
- **3. Concurrency & Synchronization**
  - 3.1 Design a thread API for controller input handling
  - 3.2 Implement locks and condition variables
  - 3.3 Simulate Producer-Consumer problem for game input/output
- **4. File System**
  - 4.1 Design a directory structure for game save files and assets
  - 4.2 Implement file creation, reading, writing, and deletion
- **5. Bonus Features (Optional)**
  - 5.1 Visualization of process scheduling queues
  - 5.2 Simulated multi-core CPU for parallel game tasks

## Resources
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Tools**: GitHub (Repository and Issues), Visual Studio Code
- **Team**: 5 members, each contributing 10-15 hours/week
- **Hardware**: Standard laptops for development and simulation

## Task Management
Tasks will be tracked using GitHub Issues. Each task will be assigned an issue number, and commits will reference these issues (e.g., `#1` for PCB design). Weekly status meetings will be simulated to review progress, identify issues, and create new tasks.

## Risks
| Risk                              | Mitigation                     |
